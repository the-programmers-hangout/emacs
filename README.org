* TPHmacs

The Emacs brigade presents =TPHmacs=, The Programmers hangout's own
little configuration for curious individuals.

It will include the bare minimum in order to spark some sort of
curiosity of how the ecosystem around Emacs works and maybe get you
started on your own configuration with this as a starting point.

Now, there are many different kinds of users and as a result, there is
no one standard to follow in terms of configuration. You should use
what fits your needs and wants the best. Ergo, we've made /multiple/
configurations for you to check out and learn from. You can find
descriptions of them below.

* Installation
Just insert the folder content into ~.emacs.d~ and you are good to go.
Note: it may be worth looking into [[https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/manual/stow.html][GNU stow]].

* Learn more
if you are new to Emacs, be sure to go through the tutorial in order
to learn the absolute basics in order to navigate and use Emacs.

You can get there by typing ~C-h t~ which is ~Ctrl-h and then t~.

And if you have gone through the tutorial and wants to know more, then
[[https://www.emacswiki.org/][The Emacs Wiki]] should hold a lot of answers to your every need.
